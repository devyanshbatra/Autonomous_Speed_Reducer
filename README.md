Traffic condition in India is highly heterogeneous consisting of vehicles of different static and dynamic characteristics. The speeds of all vehicles are non-uniform. Further, it also leads to sudden slowing down of the whole traffic stream leading to traffic congestion. Speeding of vehicles increases the chances and seriousness of accident, so that the minimisation of speeding vehicles is significant as the streets/roads. Therefore, to regulate the speeds of different category of vehicles while travelling on a sharp turn or while approaching towards an intersection or buildings like schools and hospitals, traffic calming devices are provided on the roads. Speed breakers are one of the most commonly used traffic calming devices.
